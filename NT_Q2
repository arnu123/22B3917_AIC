Statement Of Purpose for Artificial Intelligence Community

AI has fascinated a lot of minds since chatgpt came into existence, how just with a few sentences, we can get any information( upto a certain date), any code and what not. 
This field of artificial intelligence has created a boom in this world and even in my mind, of how many creative innovations we can come up with to solve various problems in this world, which until now were thought of unsolvable, but now seeming very easy to get rid of.
It had made our lives very easy in certain tasks, we can automate many things to save time, get more customers for a business by improving their experience through chatbots.

I have always wanted to start something of my own and seeing how AI can help in things related to customer experience, retention, building websites using no code AI tools to get onboarding as fast as ever.
AI can help in automating businesses. And startup is something that fascinates me a lot. This field of AI has also helped me get a startup idea which uses AI at its core leveraging MLLMs, VITs, and much more tech.

Contributing to this field, through the AI community of IIT Bombay, would be something I really look forward to and getting it at the top in hackathons, at the same time, learning AI at the very deep will help me in my future endeavors too.
